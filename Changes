0.16    2011-01-11 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add more documentation.

        - Language: Remove support for $. and $.. variable syntax (you can still

          $package::separated::var (currently translated as-is in PHP/JS
          compiler).


0.15    2011-01-11 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add more documentation.

        - Add compile(), js(), and php() in main module.

        - Language: Support octal/hexadecimal/binary number literals.


0.14    2011-01-06 (SHARYANTO)

        - Correct and expand synopsis.


0.13    2010-10-25 (SHARYANTO)

        - If hook_{var,func} returns undef, the default behaviour is used.


0.12    2010-10-25 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add hook_func property.


0.11    2010-10-16 (SHARYANTO)

        - Fix handling of quoted string.

        - All compilers get hook_var property, not just Perl.


0.10    2010-10-13 (SHARYANTO)

        - Add hook_var property to Language::Expr::Compiler::Perl.


0.09    2010-07-01 (SHARYANTO)

        - Require List::MoreUtils.


0.08    2010-06-29 (SHARYANTO)

        - PHP compiler/emitter.

        - Parser: Split rule_subscripting into rule_subscripting_{var,expr} to
          accomodate PHP's limitation (can't subscript against expression).

        - Language: because many target languages (including PHP and JavaScript)
          don't support expression before "=>", only bareword \w+ and string
          literals are now allowed in left side of pair.

        - JS: Now allows mapping Expr function to JS property (e.g.
          func_mapping->{length} = ':length').


0.07    2010-06-25 (SHARYANTO)

        - Adjust for new Regexp::Grammars 1.005.
